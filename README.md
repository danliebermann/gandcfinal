#Summary of Scripts Related with Data Cleaning

This repo contains one script called run_analysis.R that contains one function called run_analysis().
This script takes raw accelerometer data from the University of California at Irvine and transforms the raw data into a tidy data set recording the means of all raw data fields related to the mean or standard
deviation of accelerometer measurements for every combination of subject and activity.  The script writes a csv file of the tidy data to the working directory called Tidy Data.csv.

The raw data files can be found here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip .
